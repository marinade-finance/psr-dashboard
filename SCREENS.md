# Screens — PSR Dashboard

Live inventory of every page and the major panels inside them. **Keep this
file in sync with the UI** — when you add/remove/rename a column, tile,
metric, tab, or status badge, update the matching row here in the same
commit.

All pages share the same shell: `Navigation` → optional `Banner` → page
content. Routes have a Basic and an Expert variant (`/foo` and
`/expert-foo`); `level: UserLevel` propagates from the route into the page
component and downstream.

---

## Navigation

`src/components/navigation/navigation.tsx`

Top bar (`h-14`), horizontally scrollable on narrow viewports.

**Left** — Marinade logo (`<Link to="/{prefix}">`) + "PSR Dashboard /
Protected Stake Rewards" wordmark (wordmark hidden below `sm`).

**Tabs**

| Desktop label             | Mobile label | Route                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Stake Auction Marketplace | SAM          | `/{prefix}`                 |
| Protected Events          | Events       | `/{prefix}protected-events` |
| Validator Bonds           | Bonds        | `/{prefix}bonds`            |

`prefix = ''` (Basic) or `'expert-'` (Expert). Active tab styled
`bg-primary text-primary-foreground`. Hovering Events / Bonds prefetches the
respective query (`staleTime: 5min`).

**Right** — Docs link (→ `/docs` or `/expert-docs` per `level`, hidden
below `sm`), **Epoch meter**, `ThemeToggle`.

### Epoch meter

`src/components/epoch-meter/epoch-meter.tsx`. Replaces the bare
`Epoch {N}` chip. Chip shows `Epoch {auctionEpoch}` (the common case,
`auctionEpoch === networkEpoch`); only when they differ it shows
`{networkEpoch} → {auctionEpoch}`, tinted `text-warning` iff
`auctionEpoch < networkEpoch` (view is stale). A shared `HelpTip`
exposes up to three sentence-case lines: (1) the epoch the auction
allocates for, (2) the live Solana epoch + whether the view is live /
next epoch / behind the chain (omitted until the protected-events query
resolves), (3) latest protected-events settlement status — "on-chain"
(FACT) or "estimated, not yet on-chain" (ESTIMATE). Auction epoch
renders immediately from the prefetched `['sam', 0]` query; the meter
force-populates the `['protected-events']` query (`staleTime: 5 min`) so
lines 2-3 fill in without hovering the Events tab. Never blocks the nav.

---

## SAM Page (`/`, `/expert-`)

`src/pages/stake-auction-marketplace.tsx` ·
`src/components/sam-table/sam-table.tsx`

Auction data refetches every hour. Auction result is augmented in-place
with `expectedStakeChangeSol`; the table re-runs the auction whenever
`simulationOverrides` mutates (bumped via a monotonic `simulationRunId`).

### Basic vs Expert filter

`passesTableFilter`. Both modes require `bondBalanceSol > 0`. Basic mode
additionally requires the validator to be currently staked or
target-allocated **and** to have `bondGoodForNEpochs ≥
dsSamConfig.minBondEpochs`. Expert mode shows the long tail. The
jump-to-validator search bypasses the filter because the sheet reads
from the full auction set.

### Stats bar

Four `Card` tiles, `flex flex-wrap`. When ≥1 simulation is active the
whole table is wrapped in a yellow inset ring with a "Simulation Mode"
header strip carrying a **"Reset Simulation"** button.

Each tile shares one visual: a big primary value, optionally followed
by a small muted context line (same treatment as `Metric.subline` —
`text-[10px] text-muted-foreground font-mono`). The APY and
Re-delegation tiles use the context line to fold a second number into
the same card.

| Tile                | Primary value                                                                  | Context line                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Total Auction Stake | `selectSamDistributedStake(validators)` (SOL)                                  | —                                                                       |
| Winning APY         | `selectWinningAPY(auctionResult, epochsPerYear)`                               | `projected <selectProjectedAPY(...)>`                                    |
| Winning Validators  | `winningCount / totalValidators`                                               | —                                                                       |
| Re-delegation       | sum of positive `selectExpectedStakeChange` across the filtered set (SOL)      | `<redelegation / stakeAmounts.marinadeSamTvlSol> of SAM TVL` (0 if TVL≤0) |

Tooltips via `HelpTip` on each tile.

### Concentration metrics

Two-column grid below the stats bar (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3`).
Two `<ConcentrationMetric>` cards: **Top Countries** and **Top ASOs**.
The inline (non-hover) view shows only what matters at a glance: every
over-cap entry if any are capped (rank order, `text-destructive` with a
`(capped)` tag), otherwise just the single #1 entry. Each entry is a name
+ share line over a `<Gauge size="lg">` — the same shared track-and-fill
graphic the sam-table Bond column uses, larger. The fill scales the
entry's share against an absolute network-share scale (0 .. max of the
largest entry or the cap, plus headroom); a `bg-foreground/50` marker
tick sits at the per-country / per-ASO cap so an over-cap entry visibly
extends past it, with a `N% cap` label below. Hover expands a tooltip
showing the full ranked list (up to 15 entries, the fading-tail tint
palette) plus a remaining-count line.

### Jump-to-validator search

`src/components/validator-search/validator-search.tsx`. `max-w-sm` text
input below the concentration grid, aligned with the table left edge.
Accepts a vote account (exact / prefix) or a validator name (prefix /
substring) via `findMatches`. Up to 8 ranked matches in a dropdown;
click or `Enter` opens the detail sheet for that validator — even if
the validator is hidden by the Basic-mode filter, because the detail
reads from the full auction set, not from the visible table rows.

### Auction table

7 columns, sortable. **Default sort: Max APY descending.** Sort
indicator `↑`/`↓` next to active header. Table sits in a scroll-x card
(`bg-card rounded-xl border border-border shadow-card overflow-x-auto`).

| Column         | Sort key     | What's there                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#`            | `rank`       | Primary: absolute 1-based stake-priority rank from the top of the sorted auction (`#N`, `text-sm`), coloured by tip urgency, no trend arrow — the `#` appears only here. Sub-label underneath (`text-[10px]`, ~40% smaller): cutoff-relative position from `validator.values.cutoffRank` — `at cutoff`, `N above`, or `N below`; no `#` prefix, NBSP binds count to word. Ghost rows: muted same layout. Simulated rows: posColor-tinted `#N` (no sub) + `✕` clear button. Keyboard-activatable (`role="button"`, `tabIndex`). |
| Validator      | `validator`  | `<ValidatorIdentity>` — name + responsive vote account. Trailing red pulsing dot when validator has an alert (`bondRunway ≤ 5` or `bondUtilPct ≥ 85`). `PenaltyBadges` slot for the active penalty icons. |
| Max APY        | `maxApy`     | `selectMaxAPY` pill. Primary tone if in winning set, destructive-light otherwise.                                                                                           |
| Bond           | `bond`       | Bond chip (No bond / Critical / Watch / Adequate / Healthy — see § Bond chip) + dot + balance, then a compact `<Gauge size="sm">` (the shared track-and-fill component, also used larger by the Concentration metrics) + `(Nep)` runway suffix. The gauge fills proportionally to `bondGoodForNEpochs` against a fixed 100-epoch scale (so a 5ep bond reads short and a 90ep bond nearly full; runway over the cap renders a full bar — the old `100 − utilization` encoding was discarded because utilization is ≈0 for almost every validator and rendered every bar full). Fill colour follows the existing bond-health tier (`BOND_CHIP[...].bar`: primary / muted / warning / destructive) so a near-critical bond reads red even when its runway is only a few epochs. A thin `bg-destructive` tick at the danger (left) end marks the `dsSamConfig.minBondEpochs` critical floor (no number label — the `w-14` cell can't fit one without crowding the `(Nep)` token). The bond pill passes `criticalBand={0.25}`, so the leftmost 25% of the track carries a faint `bg-destructive/15` zone drawn behind the value fill — the critical-runway region reads red at a glance. The band is bond-pill-only: the `size="lg"` Concentration gauge does not pass `criticalBand` (its marker is the cap, a different semantic). Track height and fill are a uniform 4px across every row variant (normal, out-of-set, ghost, simulated, alert). The runway number is display-capped: `≥ 100` epochs renders `(>100ep)`, below that the exact rounded value (e.g. `(37ep)`). |
| Stake / Next Δ | `stakeDelta` | Active SAM stake on top, expected next-epoch change underneath. Muted `0 SOL` when delta is zero, otherwise tinted `+/−` SOL coloured `var(--status-green)` / `var(--destructive)`. |
| Next Step      | `nextStep`   | One-line tip from `getValidatorTip`, pill capped at `max-w-[260px]` so the column stays rhythmic. **Colour = severity** (urgency tint). **Icon = constraint/direction** via `getTipIcon`: bond → shield glyph, bid → bars glyph, rank → list glyph (all non-directional, severity-agnostic); only the in-set `none` case is directional and keyed off the real signed delta (↗ gain, ↘ loss, → at target) so an up-arrow can never appear on a losing/blocked row. The contiguous out-of-set "bid too low" block (`constraint:'rank'`) is an expected state, not an alarm: rendered muted with a 2-word "Bid too low" label (full sentence only in the detail panel). |
| (chevron)      | —            | Drill-in cue, recolours on row hover.                                                                                                                                       |

### Cutoff divider

A row spanning all columns separates **bid-eligible** (max APY ≥ winning
APY) from **bid-too-low** validators. Note: bond-blocked but bid-winning
validators stay above the line because they'd win on yield. Label reads
`N bid-eligible · M winning`.

### Row tints

| State                       | Background                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In set                      | `bg-card`, hover `bg-primary-light`                                                         |
| Out of set (bid-too-low)    | `bg-destructive/[0.02]`, hover `bg-destructive/[0.05]`                                      |
| Ghost (simulation original) | `opacity-40 line-through bg-muted/30` — `cursor-pointer` if the simulated target row exists, otherwise `cursor-default` |
| Simulated (post-edit)       | `ring-2 ring-inset ring-status-yellow`, `borderLeftColor` = posColor (green up, red down)   |
| Scroll-flash                | `bg-status-yellow-light` for 800ms after clicking a ghost row to jump to its new position   |

### Simulation mode

Tracked in `SamPage`: `simulationRunId`, `simulationOverrides`,
`simulatedValidators`, `originalAuctionResult`. Edits flow through
`mergeOverrides` → bump `simulationRunId` → `useQuery({ queryKey:
['sam', simulationRunId], queryFn: () => loadSam(overrides),
placeholderData: keepPreviousData })`. After a re-run, `insertGhostRows`
injects ghost entries at original positions of changed validators.
Detection of refetch completion watches `fetchStatus === 'idle'`
(v5 dropped `onSettled`).

### Bond chip

Five tiers, `BOND_CHIP` record in `sam-table.tsx`, keyed by the shared `BondHealthState` union (`bond-health.ts` — no more local duplicate type):

| Tier                | Style                                   | Meaning                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `no-bond`           | `bg-destructive-light text-destructive` | no bond posted at all (`bondBalanceSol ≤ 0`); red, label "No bond" |
| `critical`          | `bg-destructive-light text-destructive` | below penalty threshold, bond risk fee charged, OR bond below the SDK `minBondBalanceSol` minimum; red |
| `watch`             | `bg-warning-light text-warning`         | can't keep current stake; some will be undelegated |
| `soft` ("Adequate") | `bg-secondary text-muted-foreground`    | covers current stake but not ideal target          |
| `healthy`           | `bg-primary-light-10 text-primary`      | bond exceeds ideal coverage                        |

Below-minimum bond reads red, not warning-yellow: `bondHealthFromAuction` returns `critical` when `bondBalanceSol < minBondBalanceSol`, and the out-of-set tip's "Bond below minimum" branch is `urgency: 'critical'`, so chip and tip agree on tone. A validator with no bond at all is `no-bond` ("No bond") — distinct from `soft` ("Adequate"), which it was previously mislabelled as. Both `no-bond` and `critical` resolve to the same red chip via the shared `DESTRUCTIVE_CHIP` style; only the label differs.

### Validator detail sheet

`src/components/validator-detail/validator-detail.tsx`. Right-side
`Sheet`, `max-w-4xl`, mounted by `SamPage` with `key={selectedValidator
?? 'detail'}` so switching validators remounts the component. Opens
when a row is clicked. URL synced via `?v=<voteAccount>`; browser-back
closes the sheet.

**Tabs:** Overview · Notifications (when present) · Payments · Bidding ·
Bond · Bid Penalty. Bidding and Payments are purpose-built: Payments
answers "how much will I pay this epoch?" (explanatory), Bidding
answers "what should I bid to get in and win stake?" (prescriptive).
Payments sits before Bidding — you read the cost first, then act on it.
The internal `Tab` union is `'overview' | 'notifications' | 'payments' |
'bidding' | 'bond' | 'penalty'`. An inactive tab whose content needs a
look carries a small severity-toned dot and tinted label: Bond when
bond-health is critical, no-bond or watch; Bid Penalty when a bid-too-low
penalty is active; Notifications when the validator has notifications
toned to the highest priority; plus a subtle info hint on the tab the
header tip points at. Tone reuses `bondHealthFromAuction`, the penalty
breakdown's `penaltySol` and the existing notifications summary — one
shared severity axis, never a new colour or fetch. The active marker
stays visually dominant.

**Overview** — 2-col grid (`lg:grid-cols-2`, `gap-6`):

- **Stake** — Active, Target, Next epoch (each row a local `MetricRow`
  with `HelpTip`). The Next-epoch `HelpTip` notes the delta can be
  `0 SOL` even when target > active stake.
- **Bond** — Balance, Reserve / "Top up X" CTA, Bid runway, "See full
  bond coverage breakdown →" link. Balance renders 3-decimal `cost()`
  precision for a sub-1 SOL positive bond so a tiny Critical-driving
  bond never reads as "0 SOL". Bid runway is forced to "Depleted" when
  bond-health is `no-bond` or `critical` (the raw SDK
  `bondGoodForNEpochs` ignores the below-minimum gate, so it would
  otherwise contradict a Critical Reserve) — Balance, Reserve and Bid
  runway always tell one coherent story.
- **Expected Payment This Epoch** — Active stake cost, Activating stake
  cost, optional `↳ bid gap` sub-row, Penalty group (single `Penalty:
  No penalties` line OR an itemised list of `↳ bid-too-low / blacklist /
  bond risk fee` `PenaltyRow`s, each clickable to its own breakdown
  tab), Total (separated by horizontal line via `SEPARATOR_DIV_CLASS`
  from `breakdowns/row.tsx`).
- **APY Composition** (right column) — `ApyCompositionCard`. Segmented
  bar showing inflation / MEV / block rewards / stake bid. Bar widths
  use raw PMPE proportions (so they sum to total); the displayed % is
  each component's compounded APY. Threshold marker line + label at the
  winning-APY position. The `±X% vs winning` pill is green above the
  winning threshold; below it the pill becomes a button reading
  `-X% vs winning → Bidding` that switches the panel to the Bidding tab
  so the validator sees the concrete target bid.
- **What-If Simulation** (right column, when toggled on) — four numeric
  inputs (Stake bid PMPE, Inflation, MEV, Block rewards). Auto-recalcs
  with 400ms debounce. The `onSimulate` parent callback is routed
  through a `useRef` so callback identity churn does not restart the
  timer. Card has yellow border + `bg-status-yellow-light`.

**Bidding tab** — one `BiddingBreakdown` card
(`breakdowns/bidding.tsx`), a SINGLE continuous 4-column `<table>`. The
two advisory estimates are the centerpiece; the sections above feed the
target-bid math. `SectionHeader`-delimited sections, top to bottom:
Stake position → Cost-PMPE composition → Bid gap → Get into the auction
→ Get stake next epoch. The status banner is a verdict — green "Your
bid clears the winning bar — you are in the auction", red "Raise your
static bid to X PMPE …", yellow when a concentration cap is binding.
Tip footer carries "Simulate this bid to confirm the exact figure →".
The two estimate sections' `SectionHeader` `help` tooltips carry the
closed-form last-price / greedy-heuristic and verify-in-Simulate
caveats. The "Expected change next epoch" row renders `0 SOL` (never a
dash) on a real zero and carries a `HelpTip` explaining why it can be
zero even when target > active.

**Payments tab** — one `PaymentsBreakdown` card
(`breakdowns/payments.tsx`), a SINGLE continuous 4-column `<table>`,
purely the cost story. `SectionHeader`-delimited sections: Bid cost
(Active stake cost, Activating stake cost, Bid cost subtotal) →
Penalties → PSR settlements (conditional) → **Total payment**. One
status banner summarises the combined state (green "no penalties" / red
"including Y in penalties"), one tip footer carries "See bid-too-low
penalty calculation →" (when active) and "Simulate commission or bid
changes →". The "Total payment" row is black (`text-foreground`, no
severity) — it is a conclusion, not a warning.

**Shared row model** — both Bidding and Payments use the shared
4-column `RevRow` from `breakdowns/row.tsx` (`label | pct | pmpe |
value`); rows that don't use a column leave it blank, never mixed with
`CalcRow` in the same table. The column unit (`PMPE` / `SOL`) lives in
the `SectionHeader` `unit` slot, stated once per section instead of
suffixed on every row label. `CalcRow` and `RevRow` derive paddings,
dividers and weight from one shared `rowStyle()` helper.

**Tip banner** — tinted advisory strip below the header carrying the
real `getValidatorTip` text. Non-bond tips are coloured by tip urgency,
with a `Simulate →` chip when the constraint is `bid`. For
`constraint === 'bond'` tips the strip shows the short canonical bond
CTA — the byte-identical string `bondAdvice()` feeds the sam-table Next
Step pill and the Bond tab status banner (e.g. `Top up 12 SOL to avoid
the bond risk fee.`, `Bond below minimum — 18 SOL required.`) — with a
`Bond tab →` chip routing to the Bond tab. Its colour comes from
`getBondAdviceStyle(bondHealth)` — the same red / status-yellow / green
axis the Bond tab's `CalcCard` status banner uses, never from
`tip.urgency` — so the header and the Bond banner can never disagree on
tone or wording for one state. The header rank glyph keeps its own
urgency colour (it tracks overall standing, not bond health).

`MetricRow` and `PenaltyRow` are file-private helpers in
`validator-detail.tsx`; they are not exported as shared primitives.

| Amount             | total SOL paid out + Bond/Marinade split bar (hover for SOL) | always      |
| Last settled epoch | most recent fully on-chain epoch                             | always      |
| Last Epoch Bids    | bids collectable from last settled epoch                     | Expert only |

### Filters

Strip above the table.

- **Validator filter** — `<Input>`, case-insensitive substring match
  against `vote_account` and `validator.info_name`.
- **Epoch range** — `<EpochRangePicker>`. Initial bounds seeded from
  data on first non-empty load; user-narrowed selections survive
  subsequent refetches (bounds are not auto-widened).

### Events table

Generic `<Table>` inside `<TableShell>` with `TABLE_SHELL_HOVER`,
`showRowNumber`. **Default sort: Epoch DESC.**

| Column    | Notes                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validator | `<ValidatorIdentity>`                                   |
| Epoch     | integer epoch                                           |
| Reason    | human-readable string from `selectProtectedStakeReason` |
| Paid Out  | SOL amount + status badge                               |
| Funded by | funder badge                                            |

**Status badges** (Paid Out column): `Dryrun` (variant `secondary`) ·
`Estimate` (variant `default`) · no badge for finalised events.

**Funder badges**:

| Badge          | Style                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validator Bond | `bg-status-green-light text-status-green border-status-green/30` |
| Marinade       | `bg-warning-light text-warning border-warning/30`                |

## Docs Page (`/docs`, `/expert-docs`)

`src/pages/docs.tsx`

Centered `max-w-3xl` column. Renders `public/docs/GUIDE.md` (Basic) or
`public/docs/GUIDE-EXPERT.md` (Expert) through `react-markdown` with
`remark-gfm` + `rehype-raw`. Fetched as plain text via `useQuery({
queryKey: ['doc', activeDoc], staleTime: Infinity })`.

- Expert mode shows a tab strip ("Guide" / "Expert Guide") to switch
  between the two. When entering the route via a hash (e.g. from a
  breakdown "Guide →" link), the Expert page still defaults to `GUIDE`
  so the section anchor exists.
- Hash anchors work: `<a id="...">` markers in the markdown are
  honoured (via `rehype-raw`) and a `useEffect` scrolls to
  `window.location.hash` after the markdown DOM mounts (deferred one
  frame via `requestAnimationFrame`). Re-runs on tab switch.
- Links beginning with `#GUIDE` / `#GUIDE-EXPERT` switch the active doc
  instead of scrolling. All other external `a` elements open in a new
  tab.
- Card "Guide →" links from breakdown cards use
  `docsPath(level)` to pick `/docs` vs `/expert-docs`, then append a
  section anchor.

## Internal sandbox routes

Hidden from navigation. Each is served by a `*Page` wrapper that
injects fixture data into the corresponding production page, keeping
the full UI and interaction surface but bypassing live APIs.

| Route                    | Component                                                          | Wraps                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `/test-`                 | `TestSamPage` (`src/pages/test-stake-auction-marketplace.tsx`)     | `SamPage`            |
| `/test-bonds`            | `TestBondsPage` (`src/pages/test-bonds.tsx`)                       | `ValidatorBondsPage` |
| `/test-protected-events` | `TestProtectedEventsPage` (`src/pages/test-protected-events.tsx`)  | `ProtectedEventsPage` |

Fixtures: `src/fixtures/`, `src/test-validators.ts`, `src/test-bonds.ts`,
`src/test-protected-events.ts`. Test pages set `refetchInterval: false`
on the wrapped `QueryClient` queries.

## Shared visual primitives

Pointer list — for the full design language see CLAUDE.md.

- **`<Card>`** (`src/components/ui/card.tsx`) — `rounded-xl border border-border bg-card shadow-card`.
- **`<TableShell>` + `TABLE_SHELL_HOVER`** (`src/components/table/table.tsx`) — canonical outer card chrome for any page that drops a generic `<Table>` into a content section. Wraps the table in `bg-card rounded-xl border border-border shadow-card overflow-hidden overflow-x-auto`. Both the bonds and protected-events tables sit inside one. Pair with `TABLE_SHELL_HOVER` on the `<Table>`'s `className` to get the muted `bg-secondary` row-hover (the default `<Table>` hover, `bg-primary-light`, is reserved for SAM, which has its own bespoke wrapper).
- **`<Metric>`** (`src/components/metric/metric.tsx`) — KPI tile with optional `subline` + `extra` slots.
- **`<ValidatorIdentity>`** (`src/components/validator-identity/validator-identity.tsx`) — canonical "name + truncated vote account" cell.
- **`<CalcCard>`** (`src/components/breakdowns/card.tsx`) — breakdown panel chrome with optional `guideTo` link, `status` pill, and `tip` footer. Pair with `CalcRow` / `OkRow` / `SectionHeader` / `Marker` from `src/components/breakdowns/row.tsx`. Pass `total` on the conclusion row to get `separator + bold + large` in one prop; `value` defaults to `''`. The separator border is exposed for flex layouts via `SEPARATOR_DIV_CLASS`.
- **`<HelpTip>`** (`src/components/help-tip/help-tip.tsx`) — small `?` icon, Radix-based tooltip.
- **`<Gauge>`** (`src/components/gauge/gauge.tsx`) — shared track-and-fill bar: `value`/`scaleMax` fill, optional `marker` tick (0..1), semantic `tone`/`markerTone`, `size` `sm` (Bond column) / `lg` (Concentration metrics). Dumb/presentational.
- **`<Banner>`** (`src/components/banner/banner.tsx`) — dismissible announcement, persistence in `localStorage`.
- **`<ConcentrationMetric>`** (`src/components/concentration-metric/concentration-metric.tsx`) — top-N concentration card; inline name+share over a `lg` `<Gauge>` with cap marker, hover-expanded tooltip table.

## Maintenance

When you change the UI in any way that's user-visible, update this file in
the same commit:

- Add / remove / rename a column → update the corresponding column table.
- Add a new tab on the validator detail panel → list it under "Overview"
  or as its own section.
- Change a default sort, a tier threshold, a status label, or a token →
  update the relevant row.
- Move a route → update Navigation + the affected page section.

If the diff to a section is bigger than rewording, prefer rewriting the
whole section rather than patching it sentence-by-sentence — keeps the
inventory readable.
